In this digital century that we live in, we get constantly distracted by all the digital content that we see. We either use our phone, turn our television on or are just walking down the streets. Something digitally wil always try to grab our attention. Even though I used to really dislike ads on television (who doesn't?), I slowly came to appreciate those. Not necessarily because I like the products that they showcase, but more *how* they manage to show their products. There's lot of creative ways to grab a viewer's attention and this is always done differently depending on the editor.

Apple's - Don't blink commercial is a very good example of an ad that inspired many people to sort of replicate their style. Just by it's name, it makes the viewer already interested into the video and right from the get-go it already starts with texts appearing on your screen for less than a second. It goes well with the fast beat and it makes the viewers' excited because.. well if you *blink,* you might miss out on all the cool stuffs that they are about to show you. The entire flow is based around throwing quick and little snippets of their new products, which makes it mysterious and compelling. I watched the video probably over 30 times by now and yet I still sometimes come back to this, just to get some inspiration for idea's on how I want to add certain transitions or some b-roll shots. 

We have the privilege to access and watch so many content for free, that it'd be a waste if we don't manage to squeeze more out of it. Sure, every once in a while, you might want to completely zone out, that's totally fine. For the moments that you feel that you still have enough energy and attention span to write things down, I'd highly suggest to do so! Maybe you've always wanted to improve on your story-telling, browse through your favourite YouTubers and see how they script a video together. Maybe you want to improve your background for your stream, see what objects or lighting they might have that you can use as well. I can continue for on and on, but I'm sure you get the idea. 

For me personally, anything that I might even find a bit interesting or never thought of it, I immediately copy and paste the link of the video to my Notions app and put a litle note behind it. This so that in case I want to look back on something, I'm able to quickly look through my collections of litle notes. In fact one of my very first purchases for my new desk setup was actually some well made monitor arms! I got inspired by all the youtuberes who were talking about improving their overall workflow, posture and whatnot. I loved the freedom and desk space that they had and I wanted that for my desk as well. So I bought a pair of the [WALI GSDM002 Premium Dual LCD Monitor Desk Mount ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DM7N5BH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07DM7N5BH&linkCode=as2&tag=techlifeadvic-20&linkId=6bb2e7e866f91349239a54607e406920)

So if anyone tells you that you should not waste your time on watching videos or TV, tell them that you're doing it to inspire you for idea's! Tell them that it will give you benefit over time and if they still don't believe.. well just show your notes!
