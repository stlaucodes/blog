## 1. Personal name

This one is probably the easiest. If you want to showcase everything that you specifically do in your daily life, it's a no-brainer to use your full real name. Sure it might not be as easy to attract organic traffic at first (since people tend to forget names quite often, especially if the names are uncommon/less known to the reader), but at the end of the day, quality content is all that matters. Having your website to be your real name lets the target audience know that they can expect unique selfmade content created by that specific person. If they like the style, vibe, coziness of that person then the people will naturally want to find a way to stay up-to-date with their upcoming content. This will usually be done with the use of Social Media, like subscribing to a YouTube Channel, subscribing to a newsletter for a website or following people on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter. Depending on what your niche is, you can make unique content across different platforms to gain a bigger following faster. Making good quality or entertaining content is what makes the audience more interested in you. Eventually the audience will remember your name and usually these days, most people just search by typing only the keywords in Google. Once your SEO is optimized correctly (I'll write this in another post), then it doesn't matter as much if the input was slightly wrong.   

## 2. Business name

Depending on what you exactly want to do, coming up with a business name can be quite broad. I'll divide this into three sections:

* ### Custom names

  * Big tech companies like Google, NVIDIA, Amazon are all very unique names and well these aren't your basic words that you can find in your old dictionary from the 90s. These companies came up with their own brand name and had a vision in mind to what they want to deliver. Nowadays we instantly know that Google is a search engine, Netlifx where you can watch movies, Amazon pretty much your go-to order service for all kinds of products. A common trend is that some people just simply use first or last names (like Chanel, Zara). So really, you can be very creative here. 
* ### Mix of your niche, name and what you're going to provide

  * This is also a very good brand name idea (in fact that is how I came up with the name TechLifeAdvice). It gives the audience already a pretty good idea on what content they can expect before even seeing your stuffs. Compare this to real life, if let's say your computer is running slow and you want to let someone diagnostic it, would you be more tempted to bring it at "Linus Tech Tips" or at store "Random name" (assuming you've never heard of these store names before). In most cases Linus Tech Tips wins by default. It will only get beaten by other competition if their reputation and marketing is simply better. However this does not necessarily mean that Linus Tech Tips won't attract any customers anymore. Although it may not be attracting the most customers, it might still appeal to it's core customers. Perhaps the service is cheaper, perhaps the wait times are shorter, or they might provide something else that the other company doesn't do. Now you might think, yeah but on the internet it's different! There's these long standing websites that are always on the top! Why should I invest my time and energy if this other website already exist? While it is true that *some* content may already be out there, the reality is that you can never have the exact same content shown in the same way (unless it's clearly copy pasted, duh). Not being the most popular or top ranked in the search results might impact the visibility of your webpage which sucks, but in that case try to find ways to stand out. What does the other competition do that you don't do? What is the other competition not doing, what *you* could possibly do? Do this consistently and schedule all your tasks for the day in and one you'll overtake the competition instead.



## 3. Abstract your niche

Let's say that you decided on wanting to make a blog specifically oriented around a foodie or a travel blog. Well I assume at first hand you might have food or travel in your handle, but you aren't sure if it really fits because you might branch out to other type of content in the future. (I'll explain this in a later section, but you can always rebrand yourself, this doesn't matter as much). Well since they could go hand-in-hand and you know that the combination of those 2 niches (and perhaps more related niches) fits you better, then think of a name that can be contained within a more abstract and general word association. Life in Japan or Paolo from Tokyo are some examples of excellent lifestyle travel bloggers who have abstracted their brands and aren't necessarily limited to only one specific niche. Sometimes they vlog around the city, showcase some food and thus are in that sense also a foodie, but the key distinction is that they give a great variety content to the audience on what content they can sort of expect, but of course in a greater scale. Think of names that could group the names that you have in mind and perhaps that might suit you better.



## **4. Acronyms and abbreviations**

Acronyms are a cool way to sort of keep your website mysterious to the reader. No one really knows what it means or stand for, except you. They are also easier to remember and faster to type in the address bar due to the short length. Another big plus is that once you do own the short domain name and you feel that your main website name is too long, you can always configure inside your DNS settings to redirect from your short domain name to long domain name. Take AMD for example: I don't even think that anyone in their mind would type out all the characters and that your average consumer knows that it stands for Advanced Micro Devices. Oh and did you know that Intel actually is an abbrevation of Integrated Electronics? The reality is that once you've built up your brand and reputation, you're pretty much good to go. 



## 5. Mash-ups

For this you can brainstorm and note down all the words/topics that you like or describe a big part of your content. You don't necessarily have to be grammatically correct or be worried about spelling mistakes. For example we are so used to typing out our first and last name in that order. Well how about flipping it around, is that combination taken too? We're so used to these formatting standards that we don't always look outside of the box. Try to shorten words, combine them, see what looks cool and gets the tongue rolling. Think of popular names like Netflix ("internet" and "flicks"), Microsoft ("microcomputer" and "software"), Facebook ("Faces" and "Book"). They are all very creative names and make total sense when you think about it. 



## 6. Look around

Why reinvent the wheel when there's already enough inspiration for you to come up with your name? Unless you've really only followed people that use their real name as their brand, you can do a quick search on Google or YouTube and see what's out there. Perhaps even use hashtags or other type of keywords and broaden your search results. Although you might not like the exact word(s) that the person has used, you could always use an alternative word, try searching for synonyms via a thesaurus or perhaps in a different translation (like Greek, Latin or perhaps even Japanese!) If that doesn't help, well try grabbing a dictionary or go outside and look at the store name! Maybe some cool mythology, literature, movie, past experience could help as a last resort. 



## 7. Random (just do it)

Although you may still be frustrating about not being able to choose a name, keep in mind that you can always change up your mind and simply redirect the traffic from your old website to your new website! You're not bound to one specific name and especially when you're just starting out, I'd just create the website and start creating your content. Along the way it could happpen that you might be inspired by the activities and tasks that you're currently doing and could spark for some new idea's. Also a big plus is that once you've finally decided on your website name, you already have some of the content prepared! Isn't that great?
