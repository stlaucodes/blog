Hey, welcome to my website! 

In the 1% chance that you found my website, congrats! I actually don't have much to show here (yet!), but you can expect that I'll showly update this website over time. I'll keep updating the website whenever I have time. I finally found the time to set everything aside and dedicated some time to finally set everything up. So what exactly can you expect from this website, you may ask?

Well let me start by introducing myself, Hi I'm Steve! I'm currently 26 years old and over the past few years, I've worked at 4 different tech companies ranging from startups to a middle-sized company as a full stack software engineer. I've gained a lot of knowledge through my internships, all kinds of projects and real life work experience. Of course not everything has gone smooth and I'm obviously still learning every day. Besides my main job, I had always wanted to work on a project that wasn't too exhausting, yet what would still motivate me enough to keep on doing it. I had thought of creating apps, keeping a journey for stories/lifehacks and then it struck me. Why not just combine everything together and create a website for this as well? A website (well to be more specific, a blog in this case) is perfect for this as I can pretty much just showcase everything that I do. As you may have noticed, this website will be all about the tech industry. You can expect my own stories during my software engineering career, my thoughts on the tools/products that I use and some tutorials from basic stuffs to more advanced stuffs. 

Although the name of the website might imply that this will be a business oriented website, I can guarantee you that this is not the case. The direction and vision for this website is that I want to provide as much help as possible to people who would like to work in the tech industry, like software engineering students/computer science students or just anyone that is interested! I'm sure we all have typed stackoverflow in Google in hope to find a solution for our coding problem. I remember my first search was "how to center a div", hehe. I felt stupid afterwards, but the reality is that coding can be hard especially when you're just starting out! I want this website to provide the easiest way to understand different concepts while also giving it a personal touch, to make it more enjoyable to read and watch my content (yes I do plan to also create YT video's along the way!). I wanted the name to be easy to remember and something that just matches with what I want to do, hence the name Tech Life Advice!

So by creating this website, I hope to make your life easier by whatever you want to achieve in life. Thanks for reading my very first blog post. I'll be creating more content soon (a comment section will be one of my next priorities!). 

Stay safe and happy reading!
