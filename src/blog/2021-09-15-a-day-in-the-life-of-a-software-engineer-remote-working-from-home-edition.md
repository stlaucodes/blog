With the current pandemic still going on, commuting to the office by public transport is pretty much a no-go. Therefore a great deal of people (including me) are working from home. Although it is not possible to see each other face-to-face, due to the use of various communication tools like Slack, MS teams and even Zoom, these serve as great alternatives in order to still communicate with each other. Of course even then, it’s still not perfect. Sometimes you may need to talk that person multiple times and not being able to immediately approach that person, can be quite inconvenient. He might be busy doing something else or missed some text messages on his chatting program. On top of some communication issues, I must also admit that it feels more boring. Working 40 hours a week from 9 to 5 fully remotely, will feel as if you’re a hamster just trapped inside it’s running wheel. To furthur describe what’s this experience is like, I’ll segment it into tasks that I do on different parts of the day.  

9 AM 

This is the time of when I roughly wake up. I’ll brush my teeth, dress up into comfortable clothes and make myself a coffee. Heading back to the desk, the very first thing that I do is checking emails. See if I have anything important emails to read/respond to. 

9.30 AM

Every work day we have something called a Daily Standup. This is done remotely via Slack and here we take turns in telling each other on what we did on our previous workday, what we’ll do today. This is also an ideal moment to announce any matters to what may interfere with the overall workflow between you and your collegue’s. Some examples are: asking a question specific to a collegue, a dentist appointment, or any other kind of life matter really.\

10.00 - 12 PM

Usually if I don’t have any meetings or some urgent tasks I need to do, I go to the Jira board and usually fix up the issues that are still remaining in the sprint. Before every project begins we already have the upcoming sprint planned. Every sprint lasts 2 weeks and is filled with either features or some bug fixes. Whenever an issue gets fixed, this will be assigned to QA (the testing team). They will then verify if the issue got fixed. If it’s fixed then they will close the issue and else it’ll get passed back to the developer who worked on it.

12-1 PM 

Lunch time! Usually I like to cook myself some noodles or make some fried rice. If I’m really lazy for the day, I’ll get myself some bread or ramen, heh.

1-4 PM 

Back to some more work! Usually in-between it’s not exclusively coding. There’s a lot of copy-pasting from Stackoverflow (ahem, researching I mean), pair programming, reviewing each other’s code, responding to others via Slack. So in that sense, the work can actually be quite diverse and you’ll have to adapt yourself to every new situation. 

4-4.30 PM

Usually around this time I like to get myself a coffee break, just before work is about to finish. It helps me to get into the state of slowly finishing things up and taking it easy to close off the day. Unless there’s a hard deadline involvled, then you can bet that I might even work overtime. Fortunately this doesn’t happen all that often though!

5.30 PM

By this time is when I’ve commited all the latest changes and respond to any Slack messages that I’ve missed. I don’t want to be that guy to ghost that person or leave the sender hanging. I don’t read my emails though! Emails in my opinion are always used for more important topics and if I read that at the end of the day, my mind might still be in work mode for the entire evening which I don’t want to. 

6-8 PM

After a heavy day of work it’s time to eat! I’m either doing some quick groceries or cooking myself some food and watching YouTube, Twitch streams or Netflix.

8-1 PM

From here on it can be pretty much anything depending on how I feel. Either the gym, playing games, working on new content or just chilling on the sofa.

1 AM:

I usually stay awake up until this time. It’s not too late, not too early and I find this working the best for me where it’s a nice balance between some decent relaxing time and sleeping time. 

That’s pretty much it folks! That pretty much sums up my day in the life of a Software Engineer. Hope you had a nice read :). I’ll work on a comment section soon, so you guys can ask me questions whenever possible!
